# Division by Zero Error in C This repository demonstrates a common error in C programming: division by zero.  The `bug.c` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.c` provides a corrected version.  The program attempts to divide an integer by zero, which can lead to program crashes or unpredictable behavior. The solution involves adding input validation and handling potential division by zero exceptions to ensure robustness.
